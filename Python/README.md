Folder for Python Code used to gather weather data for each Football match in our data. 
setup.ipynb shows the notebook for setting up our graph.
weather_notebook shows the python code used to pull historic weather data for our football matches.

N.B. there is a limit to the amount of weather data we were allowed to pull (~4000 requests). Therefore there isn't data for all ~12,000 matches.
